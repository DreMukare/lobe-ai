            Training is how your model learns to predict the correct labels from
            your examples. You can think of your examples as a collection of
            flashcards. During training, your model will continually look
            through the flashcards and try to find similar patterns that help it
            guess the right answers.

            Lobe automatically starts training when your examples meet the
            minimum requirements. To start training, you need:

            Lobe will also follow best practices to continue training when you
            make changes to your examples. If you make large changes or
            add/remove labels, Lobe will reset training and start training a new
            model.

            Training time is quite variable and depends on how hard it is to
            distinguish between the labels in your examples and how many
            examples you have. It can take anywhere from minutes to hours, and
            sometimes days for very large problems.

            This training time estimate is updated every few seconds based on

            it fluctuate if you are performing other tasks on your computer as

            our results show you which images your model is predicting correctly
